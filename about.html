    <h2>Fun facts and things I like</h2>

    <p>Fun fact: I have been to Japan twice.</p>

    <p>Things I like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Climbing - Mostly indoors, but I go outside when the weather is nice.
        I've been doing it for 3 years and can do up to V5 or 5.11
      </li>
      <li>
        Computers - I have built a couple custom PC's and play all kinds of
        games.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cars - I have always loved cars and they are my motivation to do well as
        a developer (old JDM and overland trucks).
      </li>
      <li>
        Magic the Gathering - I have been playing since college and have a bunch
        of commander decks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Fitness and nutrition - I started my fitness journey in 2020 during
          lockdown as a way to break up the days and do something good for
          myself. I found that exercise improved my mental health tremendously
          and that was all I needed to stick with it. I have learned so much in
          the last few years about exercise efficacy and general nutrition. I
          was also lucky enough to find a sport that keeps me motivated to train
          and has mesurable progress built in.
